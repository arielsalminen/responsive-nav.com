  <p>Responsive Nav is a tiny JavaScript plugin (weighs ~1kb) which helps you to create toggled navigation for smaller screens. It uses touchstart and CSS3 transitions for the best possible performance. It also uses a “clever” workaround which makes it possible to transition from <em>max-height: 0</em> to <em>max-height: auto</em> which isn’t normally possible with CSS3&nbsp;transitions.</p>
